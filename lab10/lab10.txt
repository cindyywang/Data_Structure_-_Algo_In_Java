What about abstract/interface?: Y, we can.
//can have two generics<S, T>
public class Box<T>
{
    T ITEM;
        public Box(T item)
        {
            this.item = item;
        }
}

Iterator interface
hasNext()
next()
when implement interface must have the two above, but can be implemented differently
default remove()
when implement default, it will already have had

while(iterator.hasNext())
{
    a = iterator.next();
}

enhance for loop

ArrayList<Point> a = newArrayList<Point>();
for(Point x: a)
{
    print(x);
}

// a has to implement Iterable
iterator()
return an iterator obj
